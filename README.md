# OSUBuckThat

As of right now, the directory has been initialized using the Middleman gem on Ruby v2.3.1.
To build the website, run the command `middleman build` in the terminal from the root site directory.
To view the website, run the command `middleman server` and navigate to localhost:4567 (port number can
change if port 4567 is already in use).

The last snapshot of the previous Buck That website can be viewed here:

We should be able to pull some of the assets from there to reuse.

Re-implementing last build we would need to design the following pages:
 * Home Page
 * About Us
 * Members
 * Music & Media
 * Contact & Booking
 * Guestbook
 
Looking at other A Cappella group websites, we could consider:
 * Social Media
 * Repertoire
 * Press/News
 * Alumni
 * Events
  
Partials include (but not limited to):
 * Header
 * Footer
  
Overall, the website is what we make it. If you have an idea, implement it. If one
of the pages seems outdated, drop it.

Some example websites:
 * http://madhattersuw.squarespace.com/#the-madhatters-live-at-the-capitol-theater
 * http://www.thegmen.org/
 * http://drexelcleftomaniacs.wixsite.com/drexelcleftomaniacs
 * http://www.melodores.com/
 * http://www.whiffenpoofs.com/
 * http://voicesinyourhead.org/
 
So, I'm not sure what else to write at the moment. Go Bucks.
